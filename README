This module is not very general purpose, although it was made more modular and 
cleaner before GitHub release. Regardless, it still only supports Debian Squeeze 
(6.x) and Wheezy (7.x). Ubuntu could be added to the list with relatively few 
changes.

Other limitations include lack of support for any other form of authentication 
except BASIC auth via Apache and LDAP, and for other databases besides 
postgresql. Managing trac.ini is not supported, either.

Any contributions to improve this module are most welcome!
